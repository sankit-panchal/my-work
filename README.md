# my stuff related to scrips and playbook
This repository contains my work regarding bash and ansible.

I am a Linux professional, having good knowledge on Bash and Ansible, however I am still learning and eager to learn new tools/technology.

I have a 10+ yrs of experiance in IT industries and worked with various clients throughout my career.

For security reasons these scripts and playbooks have been modified with universal name such as /home/user for home directory.
